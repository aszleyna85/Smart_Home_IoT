# 🏠 Smart Home IoT Network (Ongoing Project)

This project is part of my **networking fundamentals learning journey** using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
I’m simulating a **smart home environment** with IoT devices connected via a home gateway.  
This is an **ongoing project teaser**, as I’m currently in week 3 of my class.

## 🧠 Project Idea
The goal is to design and configure a **smart home network** where IoT devices connect securely to the internet.  
This setup represents a simplified version of a real-world connected home.

## 🛠️ Current Setup (Week 3)
- **Core Devices:**
  - Internet cloud
  - IoT Registration Server
  - Coaxial Splitter
  - Cable Modem
  - Home Gateway (Wi-Fi)
  
- **Connected Devices:**
  - Indoor Security Camera (Living Room)
  - Smart TV (Living Room)
  - PS4 Console (Living Room)
  - Thermomix Smart Appliance (Kitchen)
  - Smartphone 1 (Living Room)
  - Smartphone 2 (Kitchen)
  - Laptop 1 (Kitchen)
  - Laptop 2 (Living Room)

✅ All devices are connected to Wi-Fi via the **Home Gateway**.  
✅ Devices are registered successfully on the IoT server.  

---

## 📈 Progress So Far
- Designed topology and added IoT devices.  
- Configured wireless connectivity (SSID, WPA2).  
- Registered devices with IoT server.  
- Verified communication between IoT devices and the network.  

---

## 🎯 Next Steps
- Add **security features** (MAC filtering, firewall basics).  
- Enable **remote access control** for smart devices.  
- Implement **automation scenarios** (e.g., Thermomix sends notification when done cooking).  
- Expand the network to simulate **more complex IoT environments**.
